      <div>
      <h2>This is a tool to test for XSS vulnerabilities on websites, mainly in text boxes.</h2>
      <div>
      <div>This tool can be used by right-clicking in a text box on a potentially vulnerable website and selecting from the list of possible payloads:</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <h3>Simple HTML Injection:</h3>
      <div>
      <div>Simple HTML header injection with a red background.</div>
      <div>If this is displayed on the webpage, it indicates vulnerability to further HTML injection.</div>
      </div>
      <h3>Simple Javascript Injection:</h3>
      <div>
      <div>Simple JavaScript alert injection.</div>
      <div>If an alert is displayed, it indicates vulnerability to further and more malicious JavaScript injection.</div>
      </div>
      <h3>iFrame Onload Injection:</h3>
      <div>
      <div>HTML iFrame (invisible) with onload event JS that generates an alert.</div>
      <div>This alert tries to grab the website's URL and cookies.</div>
      <div>If this is successful, it indicates vulnerability to hidden JS in injected HTML elements.</div>
      <div>It would also indicate that the website's information could be compromised (ex. a session cookie is stolen to login without a password)</div>
      </div>
      </div>
      </div>
</div>
